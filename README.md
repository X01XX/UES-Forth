Eating my own cooking, using my Memory Management code to implement an Unorthodox-Expert-System on a language that has limited support for memory management.
And I like Forth.

See the README.md for the forth-memory-management and Unorthodox-Expert-System projects, and theory.html.

As usual, rethinking everything.

To run:

> gforth

> include main.fs

> all-tests | main

A prrogram that can learn (at a low level), avoid negative states, seek positive states (a little more work is needed) and run
on a Raspberry Pi class computer.
