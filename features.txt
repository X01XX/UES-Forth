Uses home-grown memory management.
    Uses heap memory for data (allocate) instead of memory within the dictionary (alloc).

Bits value is a number, not a struct.  No difference between state or mask.
Limited by cell size, use of the sign bit may be tricky.

square pnc calc a little different.

square compare: pn 1 square rule cannot be compatible with both rules in a pn 2 square. 
                pn 1 square can be compatible to one rule in a pn-2 square, if num results are 1.
                2 X 2 can be compatible but not yet pnc.
                Change 9 possible pn comparisons into 4 functions, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-to-not-3.
                                                                   3-3 is Compatible without further tests.

Action dissimilar square pairs, whence the logical structure, is the starting point.

Square and group pn value is not stored, it is gleaned from the rulestore contents.

I found that there can be a problem in getting closer non-adjacent incompatible pairs, of two-result states.
I decided to make a fairly big change in the union of rules.
Rule unions were by same change (0->1 + 1->0) mask, or same result, (X->1, X->0).
Now rule unions are by same change mask only.
