Uses home-grown memory management.
    Uses heap memory for data (allocate) instead of memory within the dictionary (alloc).

Bits value is a number, not a struct.  No difference between state or mask.
Limited by cell size, use of the sign bit may be tricky.

square pnc calc a little different.

square compare: pn 1 square rule cannot be compatible with both rules in a pn 2 square. 
                pn 1 square can be compatible to one rule in a pn-2 square, if num results are 1.
                2 X 2 can be compatible but not yet pnc.
                Change 9 possible pn comparisons into 4 functions, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-to-not-3.
                                                                   3-3 is Compatible without further tests.

Action dissimilar square pairs, whence the logical structure, is the starting point.

Square and group pn value is not stored, it is gleaned from the rulestore contents.

Changed rule union logic for two-result states.
If both orders of union work, instead of just one order, then
try union by change mask ( 0->1 + 1->0 ) only.
