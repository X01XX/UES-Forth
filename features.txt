Uses home-grown memory management.
    Uses heap memory for data (allocate) instead of memory within the dictionary (alloc).

Bits value is a number, not a struct.  No difference between state or mask.
Limited by cell size, use of the sign bit may be tricky.

square pnc calc a little different.

square compare: pn 1 square rule cannot be compatible with both rules in a pn 2 square. 
                pn 1 square can be compatible to one rule in a pn-2 square, if num results are 1.
                2 X 2 can be compatible but not yet pnc.
                Change 9 possible pn comparisons into 4 functions, 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-to-not-3.
                                                                   3-3 is Compatible without further tests.

Action logical structure, dissimilar square pairs, is the starting point.
